# DOCUMENTATION DESCRIPTION 
## INSTALLATION PROCESS
This document provides a complete walkthrough of the Parrot OS installation process using Oracle VM VirtualBox. It covers all essential steps, from downloading the necessary ISO file to configuring the virtual machine and completing the installation. The guide is tailored for users who want to run Parrot OS in a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing, software development, or educational purposes.

It includes detailed instructions on setting up system parameters such as memory allocation, disk size, and system architecture, along with screenshots and explanations to ensure a smooth and error-free setup. This documentation is especially helpful for beginners or anyone new to virtual machine environments, offering a clear and structured approach to deploying Parrot OS safely and efficiently.
## SYSTEM CALL
The sysinfo() system call in Parrot OS (a Debian-based Linux distribution) is used to retrieve system statistics and overall resource usage. It provides essential information such as system uptime, total and free RAM, shared memory, buffer and cache usage, number of running processes, and load averages.

This call is defined in the <sys/sysinfo.h> header and returns data in a struct sysinfo, making it useful for system monitoring tools, diagnostics, or performance analysis applications. Parrot OS, being Linux-based, supports this system call natively, allowing users and developers to gather real-time system metrics efficiently.
